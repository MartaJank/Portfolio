    "bio": "I am passionate about music, literature, crafting, travelling and languages. This last passion lead me to discover recently a new one, programming languages. I started to discover it when working in HP as a Project Manager since I was responsible of writing printer maintenances in HTML and CSS. After that, I realised I wanted to study coding and I enrolled in an Ironhack coding bootcamp. Once I finished, I had the opportunity to work as a Teacher Assistant in Ironhack, helping students understand code basics and also enhancing my own understanding of it by teaching. Currently I am searching for a job in web development to continue with this path I fell in love with.",
